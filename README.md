# A Dataset of Clinical Gait and U-Turns Signals with Wearable Sensors from Hemiplegic Post-Stroke Patients

This repository provides code snippets to load the dataset published as open source. It can be downloaded through [XXXX](XXXX) (~1.07 GB).

## Description rapide du dataset publié

The dataset provides 180 gait trials from 30 hemiplegic post-stroke participants equipped with four inertial measurement units placed on the head, lower back, and dorsal part of each foot. 
They followed a standardized protocol involving a basic sequence of activities: 
- standing still
- walking straight ahead
- turning around 180° (u-turn)
- walking back to the starting point
- stopping

The published dataset comprises a comprehensive collection of kinematic and kinetic data obtained from hemiplegic patients performing u-turns before and after rotation, encompassing a detailed analysis of gait parameters. Its quality is also ensured by the breadth of metadata provided from clinical examinations and reference clinical scales.
